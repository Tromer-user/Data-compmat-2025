# Dataset: Barrier Calculations for 2D Materials from the C2DB Database

This dataset contains computed barrier values for ionic movement in two-dimensional (2D) materials, based on structures extracted from the **Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB)**. The barrier values were obtained using a **H√ºckel-type approximation** developed in our work, with values reported along different crystallographic directions.

## üß™ Methodology Summary

- Structural and compositional data were sourced from the [C2DB](https://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/c2db/).
- Ionic migration barriers in X, Y, and XY directions were estimated using a **H√ºckel-based potential energy approximation**.
- All properties like energy, gap, thickness, etc., refer to standard DFT values as available in the C2DB.
